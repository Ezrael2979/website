      <p>
        All projects are hosted privately and securely on <a
            href="https://github.com">GitHub.com</a>, allowing you to observe
        the development of your project and exactly who is working on what, at
        all times. There is never a point in time where you do not have full
        access to your code.

      <h4><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> Automated Testing</h4>
      <p>
        We employ Test-Driven Development principles and follow
        Continuous-Integration methodology. All code goes through peer-review
        and strenuous automated and manual testing, and staging deployment
        before being deployed to production.

        We utilize a combination of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com">Amazon Web
        Services</a> and <a href="https://digitalocean.com">DigitalOcean</a> to
        provide maximal uptime and stability, and security of the data backing

        Yes, we know what MODBUS, HART, and Programmable Logic Controllers are,
        although we do not recommend using them. Our specialty is building
        scalable mobile-first responsive web applications.

      <p>
        We love pilot projects. Do you want to build something nobody has ever
        built before? Raspberry Pi? Bluetooth LE? Wearables? Bitcoin? The
        Internet of Things? These are the crazy kinds of things we're interested
        in, and if you are as well, then we'd love to work with you!

        Maybe none of these blurbs jump out to you as exactly what you need. So,
        tell us! Give us a call and see what we can come up with, together.
        You'll be glad you did.
